Warren Buffet""","""Dear Sir/Madam,

I am pleased to inform you that your account has been successfully created. However, I must caution you against the dangers of over-reliance on any single platform or service.

As someone who has spent a lifetime studying probability and uncertainty, I must advise you to always have a backup plan in case of unforeseen circumstances. While I have faith in our platform's robustness, it is always better to be prepared for the worst.

In any case, I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors, and hope that our service will prove to be a valuable tool in your arsenal.

Sincerely,

Nassim Taleb""","""Dear Sir/Madam,

I hereby confirm that your registration with our service has been completed successfully. But before you go, I must ask you a question.

Do you believe that you are an extraordinary person, above the law and the moral constraints that bind ordinary mortals? Do you believe that you have the right to act as judge, jury, and executioner, and that the ends justify the means?

If so, then you may find our service to be useful in furthering your grand schemes. But beware, for the path of the extraordinary is a lonely and dangerous one, filled with pitfalls and moral ambiguities.

If not, then I suggest you reconsider your decision to join us. For our service is not for the faint of heart, nor for those who seek easy solutions to life's problems.

I leave the decision in your capable hands.

Sincerely,

Raskolnikov""","""Dear friend,
