Moreover, the same word applies to all the leaves on all trees, big ones, small ones, tender ones, dried ones, yellow ones, green ones, banana leaves. So if I say to you that I saw a leaf this morning, you really don’t have an idea of what I saw.   Let’s see if you can understand that.

Nietzsche’s famous expression “what does not kill me makes me stronger” can be easily misinterpreted as meaning Mithridatization or hormesis. It may be one of these two phenomena, very possible, but it could as well mean “what did not kill me did not make me stronger, but spared me because I am stronger than others; but it killed others and the average population is now stronger because the weak are gone.” In other words, I passed an exit exam.

It should be noted that those who are passionate about practice and learning to actually practice correctly are much more likely to make progress than those who are not. Those who are able to channel all their rage, frustration, lust, greed, despair, confusion and anguish into trying to find a better way are the only ones who are likely to have what it takes to finally attain freedom. Those who are actually able to sit with the specific sensations that make up rage, lust, anger, confusion and all the rest with clarity, precision, acceptance of their humanity, and equanimity are even more likely to get enlightened.

All vice is such a separation, as the Stoics define virtue to be an agreement or harmony with “nature” in our affections and actions. They tell us this nature is two-fold, the common nature presiding in the universe, or the deity, and the individual or proper nature in each one. We conform to the common nature, by acquiescence in all events of providence, and by acting the part which the structure of our proper nature requires and recommends, especially the governing part of it, we at once conform to both the common nature and the proper; since our constitution was framed by God, the common nature. 54

Warriors are concerned with discussing, understanding, and employing that connecting link. They are especially concerned with cleaning it of the numbing effects brought about by the ordinary concerns of their everyday lives. Shamanism at this level can be defined as the procedure of cleaning one's connecting link to intent.

When you find yourself, in a morning, averse to rise, have this thought at hand: I arise to the proper business of a man: And shall I be averse to set about that work for which I was born, and for which I was brought into the universe? Have I this constitution and furniture of soul granted me by nature, that I may lye among bed-cloaths and keep my self warm? But, say you, This state is the pleasanter. Were you then formed for pleasure, and not at all for action, and exercising your powers?

And will you decline to act your part as a man for this purpose? Won’t you run to that which suits your nature? But, say you, must we not take rest? You must: but nature appoints a measure to it, as it has to eating and drink-ing. In rest you are going beyond these measures; beyond what is sufficient: but in action, you have <113> not come up to the measure; you are far within the bounds of your power: you don’t then love yourself; otherwise, you would have loved your own nature, and its proper will or purpose.

How did Graham do it? Combining his extraordinary intellectual powers with profound common sense and vast experience, Graham developed his core principles, which are at least as valid today as they were during his lifetime: • A stock is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an ownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value that does not depend on its share price.

Just as sensible gamblers take, say, $100 down to the casino floor and leave the rest of their money locked in the safe in their hotel room, the intelligent investor designates a tiny portion of her total portfolio as a “mad money” account. For most of us, 10% of our overall wealth is the maximum permissible amount to put at speculative risk. Never mingle the money in your speculative account with what’s in your investment accounts; never allow your speculative thinking to spill over into your investing activities; and never put more than 10% of your assets into your mad money account, no matter what happens.

Their actions are in perpetual changes, and the causes subject to ten thousand <129> alterations. Scarce any thing is stable. And the vast eternities, past and ensuing, are close upon it on both hands; in which all things are swallowed up.

There is an old Zen story about a king whose people had grown soft and entitled. Dissatisfied with this state of affairs, he hoped to teach them a lesson. His plan was simple: He would place a large boulder in the middle of the main road, completely blocking entry into the city. He would then hide nearby and observe their reactions. How would they respond? Would they band together to remove it? Or would they get discouraged, quit, and return home? With growing disappointment, the king watched as subject after subject came to this impediment and turned away. Or, at best, tried halfheartedly before giving up. Many openly complained or cursed the king or fortune or bemoaned the inconvenience, but none managed to do anything about it. After several days, a lone peasant came along on his way into town. He did not turn away. Instead he strained and strained, trying to push it out of the way. Then an idea came to him: He scrambled into the nearby woods to find something he could use for leverage. Finally, he returned with a large branch he had crafted into a lever and deployed it to dislodge the massive rock from the road. Beneath the rock were a purse of gold coins and a note from the king, which said: “The obstacle in the path becomes the path. Never forget, within every obstacle is an opportunity to improve our condition.”

Nothing can befall a man which is not a natural incident of mankind; nor to an ox, nor to a vine, nor to a stone, which is not a natural incident to these species. If, then, that alone can befall any thing, which is usual, and naturally incident to it, what cause is there for indignation? The presiding nature of the whole hath brought nothing upon you, which you cannot bear?

If you are grieved about anything external, ’tis not the thing itself that afflicts you, but your judgment about it; and it is in your power to correct this judgment and get quit of it. If you are grieved at any thing in your own disposition; who hinders you to correct your maxims of life? If you are grieved, because you have not accomplished some sound and virtuous design; set about it effectually, rather than be grieving that it is un-done. “But some superior force withstands.” Then you have no cause of sorrow; for, the fault of the omission lyes not in you. “But, life is not worth retaining, if this be not accomplished.” Quit life, then, with the same serenity, as if you had accom-<201>plished it; and with good-will, even toward those who withstand you. 48.

The 1 percent rule is a very simple maxim that states if a property will rent for 1 percent of the price you paid for it, it’s likely to cash-flow positively. This is a very important metric for us as BRRRR investors are those looking to keep properties as rentals, not sell them as flips. To put it simply, if a property will rent for $1,000, and you paid $100,000 for it, it meets the 1 percent rule. A $200,000 house should rent for $2,000, and a $150,000 house for $1,500.

Demand for areas is dependent on how many people want to move there. Supply for an area is determined by how many properties are available for people to move into. Pretty simple, right? I’m going to give you an overview of how to determine the demand for an area as well as how to determine if there is insufficient supply. Understanding these factors helps protect your investment from a decline in value as does choosing areas that are likely to appreciate at a rate faster than the national average.

Another huge factor people consider when moving is affordability. How much house can someone get for an area’s median salary? If you live in a city where the median salary is $50,000 yearly, talk to a lender and find out how much the average person earning that salary can borrow. Once you have that number (let’s say for this example it’s $250,000), go online and look at what the average house looks like that’s listed at $250,000. If the houses look updated and impressive, there isn’t much incentive for someone to move any farther away. If the houses don’t look updated or impressive, assume that buyers/ tenants will start looking elsewhere. Look around the city and find which neighborhoods have really nice houses and at what price point they are. If you find a pocket where houses listed for $200,000 have beautiful upgrades, bigger yards, more space, etc., you just may have found the next market to appreciate. Understanding how buyers think is crucial to understanding how to determine market value.

First, ask a Realtor for the average DOM (days on market) it takes houses to sell there. As a Realtor myself, I can tell you this is an underrated way to gather intel on the pulse of a market, which investors don’t look at often enough. Because most of us are investing for cash flow and passive income, we too often get sucked into the numbers on a spreadsheet and ignore other factors like DOM.

Buying in the path of progress allows you to pay less when you buy, wait, then see appreciation. It is one of the tricks for “buy low, sell high.” Most of the BRRRR process is about forced appreciation. This is appreciation we create through buying right, wise renovations, and a shrewd understanding of numbers. While forced appreciation is usually a safer bet because you control it, you’d have to be a fool to just ignore market appreciation as well. Market appreciation should always be looked at like icing on the cake. Your BRRRR process is the actual cake.

My favorite exercise for examining suffering is to sit in a quite place with my eyes closed and examine the physical sensations that make up any sort of desire, be it desire to get something, get away from something or just tune out and go to sleep. At a rate of one to ten times per second, I try to experience exactly how I know that I wish to do something other than simply face my current experience as it is. Moment to moment, I try to find those little uncomfortable urges and tensions that try to prod my mind into fantasizing about past or future or stopping my meditation entirely. For that meditation period, they are my prey and nourishment, opportunities to understand something extraordinary about reality, and so I do my very best to let none of them arise and pass without the basic 27 The Three Characteristics sense of dissatisfaction in them being clearly perceived as it is. I turn on sensations of the desire to get results, turn on the pains and unsettling sensations that make my mind contract, turn on the boredom that is usually aversion to suffering in disguise, turn on the sensations of restlessness that try to get me to stop meditating. Anything with fear or judgment in it is my bread and butter for that meditation period. Any sensation that smacks of grandiosity or self-loathing is welcomed as a source of wisdom.

If you are happily married and have a fully satisfying sex life, you will not spank Jimmy. Spanking is literally a hatred of the flesh, and the flesh means the body with all its demands and longings. If you love your own flesh, you won’t want to make Jimmy’s flesh hurt.” Parents can beat their children as much as they please as they don’t leave welts that can be seen in a magistrate’s court.

If humans were born with an instinct for criminality, there would be as many criminals from fine middle-class homes as from slum homes. But well-to-do people have more opportunities for expression of the ego. The pleasures money buys, the refined surroundings, culture, and pride of birth all minister to the ego. Among the poor, the ego is starved. Only a very few poor boys attain distinction. To be a criminal, a gangster, even a bully is one way of attaining distinction.

As Secretary I should abolish all so-called reform schools and substitute coeducational colonies throughout the land. I should at once set up special training centers for staffing these with teachers and housemothers. Each colony would be completely self-governing. The staff would have no special privileges. They would have the sure food and heating as the pupils. Pupils would be paid for any community work they did. The watch-word of the colony would be freedom. No religion, no moralizing, no authority would be tolerated. I would exclude religion because religion talks, it preaches, it tries to sublimate, it suppresses. Religion postulates sin where sin does not exist. It believes in free will when for some children enslaved by their compulsions, there is no free will. In the place of religious conditioning, I would advocate that emotions be conditioned by love and by nothing that is cruel and unjust.

The housebreaking youth is conscious that he wants to acquire money or goods, but he does not know the deep motive that makes him choose this way of getting money instead of the social way of earning it. That motive is buried, and that is why moral lectures or punishments never cure him. Scoldings are heard only by his ears, and punishments are felt only by his body. But these preachments and punishments never penetrate to the unconscious motive, which controls his behavior.

Because this is so, religion cannot reach a boy’s unconscious through preachment. But, if some night his curate went out scaling with him, that action would begin to dissolve the self- hatred responsible for the antisocial behavior. That sympathetic kinship would start the boy thinking in different terms.

The child receives his conscience from his mother, his father, his teacher, his minister--from his environment, in general. His unhappiness is the result of the conflict between conscience and human nature; or in Freudian terms, between his super-ego and his id. Conscience may win so complete a victory that the boy becomes a monk, and entirely renounces the world and the flesh. In most uses, a compromise takes place-a compromise that is partly expressed in the phrase, “to serve the devil on weekdays and to serve God on Sundays.”

No child under eight is selfish; he is only an egoist. In the case of a boy of six whose father teaches him to be unselfish and beats him when he is selfish, his conscience at first is objective: I must share my sweets when father is looking. But a process of identification begins. The boy wants to be as big as father--the power motive. He wants to have as much of mother as father has. He identifies himself with father. And in the process, he takes his father’s philosophy. He becomes a little Conservative or a little Liberal. He, as it were, adds his father to his own soul. Conscience, formerly father’s voice from without, now becomes father’s voice from within. This is the process by which some people become Baptists or Calvinists or Communists.

That is the crowd aspect. But the individual is anti-life in his everyday existence. His love-making is in the main unsatisfactory; his pleasures are mostly tawdry, cheap, escapist. He is a moralist, that is, one who considers natural living to be wrong or at the best inadequate, and he trains his children accordingly.

Do you deem it important that both persons in a marriage should be on the same intellectual level? The intellectual side of marriage is a minor one. A marriage of heads is a dull, cold affair; whereas a marriage of hearts is one of warmth and giving. Nature does not make a man or a woman fall in love because of the intellectual prowess of the partner. Later, however, when the sex urge weakens, a common intellectual interest will tend to make a couple happy. The same brand of humor is perhaps the best prognosis for a long happy marriage.

Define the manuscript’s focus before you begin writing it (and definitely before you query any editors about it). Decide what should and should not be covered. Decide, too, the range of coverage within your focus. Take “Umpires Are Demolishing the Legal Strike Zone.” The article itself, over two brief pages, theorizes that some baseball greats would have had lackluster careers if they were playing today: Many of pitcher Jim Palmer’s strikes would be called balls today; notorious high-ball hitter Ted Williams would have struck out more and hit fewer home runs had today’s low strike zone been in force during his day. Had the writer then brought in the point that many fans are upset with the strike zone, he would have had to convince us of that point. He couldn’t just say it. He’d have to cite fan polls or quote some season ticket holders, and in doing so he’d have to convince us that the polls were valid, and that the quoted fans had enough knowledge of the sport for the reader to give them credence.

Next, list two secondary goals. What gives the piece added value? What gives it texture? What makes it interesting? fun to read? something the reader will enjoy as well as benefit from? For example, I define the goals of this book this way. Primary goal: to teach techniques of writing with as few words as possible. Secondary goals: 1) to give insight into the language, and how the very structure of the language can be employed to keep writing trim and efficient, and 2) to keep these matters of language use, which are often picayune, from becoming boring, so that the subject remains as lively as the language itself.

Now that you’re satisfied with what you’re trying to accomplish, judge what you write, sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, against its goals. Let’s go back to our example story, about the umpires demolishing the legal strike zone. The article talks about how the modern strike zone is lower than it was in the 1950s. The goals of the article are to prove that the zone has indeed moved and demonstrate how that has changed the game. You do that with information and numbers and quoted opinion from people involved with the game, primarily umpires, batters, catchers, pitchers and the occasional manager. You don’t do that with opinions about how the height of outfield fences has changed over the years, a history of the introduction of artificial turf, or a funny Yogi Berra quote about how umpires dress.

Familiarize yourself with the enemy—and there are thousands of them. To list tautologies at length here would mire us in a long digression. For an alphabetical listing of common redundancies, see the Baedeker of the Redundant on page 187. 2. Read your copy carefully. Pause at the “invisible” words. “And” is invisible; “also” is invisible; “and also” is neither more nor less visible, unless you’re looking for it. Pause at two-word combinations. If you encounter a double noun, drop one to see if the sentence still makes sense; if an adverb-verb or adjective-noun, drop the modifier to see if you lose anything. If you can drop “advance” from “advance planning,” do it. 3. Maintain an active vocabulary that is not only broad but also deep. Learn not just what words mean, but what they imply, what they embrace. Read not only for the sake of the writing but also for the sake of the words; read to learn words. And don’t rely purely on your ear and on the context of speech and of writing to educate you about word meanings. Look words up, but don’t stop there. Hunt words. As you read dictionary definitions, dig into their origins, their evolution, and their present scope.

And if you’re not interested in the weather, will it snow? In this case, the newscaster can assume that his or her audience is interested. (If it isn’t interested, why even mention the topic?) Other such empty introductions include: For your information… In case you were wondering… The facts are these:

When you spot such potentially empty verbs, scan the rest of the sentence for another verb. In “The city provides street-cleaning services,” we spot “provides” and scan to find “clean,” though it’s been disguised as a noun (“cleaning”). The second verb you find is often stronger; if so, that one should propel your sentence. (I further discuss verb-into-noun conversions as a warning signal of wordiness on page 119.)

Eliminate the “deadwould.” That’s what Joe Floren in Write Smarter, Not Harder calls the often unnecessary “would.” “I would agree with you.” You would? Under what circumstances? “I agree with you” does the job—unless you mean something like “I would agree with you if you were right.” It’s sometimes better to be a “have not” than a “have.” Sometimes “have” can be eliminated by casting the sentence in the past tense instead of the past perfect. “I have made my bed” communicates little more than “I made my bed” does. “We have eaten breakfast and have gone to the store” doesn’t tell us anything different from “We ate breakfast and went to the store.” 6. The Weak, the Noncommittal, and the Hesitant Weak writing is meek writing, more timid than evasive. In college, for instance, I told my girlfriend that I was in love with her. She bristled.

The move away from the use of propositions in commercial advertising began at the end of the nineteenth century. But it was not until the 1950’s that the television commercial made linguistic discourse obsolete as the basis for product decisions. By substituting images for claims, the pictorial commercial made emotional appeal, not tests of truth, the basis of consumer decisions. The distance between rationality and advertising is now so wide that it is difficult to remember that there once existed a connection between them. Today, on television commercials, propositions are as scarce as unattractive people.

Tyrants of all varieties have always known about the value of providing the masses with amusements as a means of pacifying discontent. But most of them could not have even hoped for a situation in which the masses would ignore that which does not amuse. That is why tyrants have always relied, and still do, on censorship. Censorship, after all, is the tribute tyrants pay to the assumption that a public knows the difference between serious discourse and entertainment—and cares. How delighted would be all the kings, czars and führers of the past (and commissars of the present) to know that censorship is not a necessity when all political discourse takes the form of a jest.

It's ego. It's greed. It's envy. It's fear. It's mindless imitation of other people. I mean, there are a variety of factors that cause that horsepower of the mind to get diminished dramatically before the output turns out. And I would say if Charlie and I have any advantage it's not because we're so smart, it is because we're rational and we very seldom let extraneous factors interfere with our thoughts. We don't let other people's opinion 35 interfere with it... we try to get fearful when others are greedy. We try to get greedy when others are fearful. We try to avoid any kind of imitation of other people's behavior. And those are the factors that cause smart people to get bad results. I always look at IQ and talent as representing the horsepower of the motor, but then in terms of the output, the efficiency with which the motor works, depends on rationality. That's because a lot of people start out with 400-horsepower motors and get a hundred horsepower of output. It's way better to have a 200-horsepower motor and get it all into output. So why do smart people do things that interfere with getting the output they're entitled to? It gets into the habits, and character and temperament, and it really gets into behaving in a rational manner. Not getting in your own way.

An excess of what seems like professionalism will often wind up hurting you horribly precisely because those careful procedures themselves often lead to overconfidence in their outcome... Long Term Capital Management, the well-known hedge fund recently collapsed as a result of its principals' overconfidence in their highly leveraged methods. And it collapsed despite those principals having IQ's that must have averaged 160 or more...Smart, hard-working people aren't exempt from professional disasters resulting from overconfidence. Often they just go aground in the more difficult voyages on which they choose to embark based on self appraisals in which they conclude that they have superior talents and methods. It is, of course, irritating that extra care in thinking isn't all good- that it also introduces extra error. But most good things have undesired "side effects." And thinking is no exception.

An example of statistical misuse is from 1992 when it was reported that 28 teenagers who frequently played the game of "Dungeons and Dragons" (D&D) committed suicide. What conclusion should be drawn? Is there a link between teenage suicide and the game? The American mathematician John Allen Paulos tells us in Innumeracy to put this statement into the right perspective by considering two more facts. The game sold millions of copies and about 3 million teenagers played it. In that age group the annual suicide rate is about 12 people per 100,000. This means chat we can expect 360 D&D playing teenagers (12/100,000 x 3 million players) to commit suicide.

john wants to make extra money and is offered to play Russian Roulette. If John wins he gets $10 million. Should he play? There are 6 equally likely possible outcomes when he pulls the trigger - empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, bullet. This makes the probability 5/6 or 83%. This is the same as saying that John is playing a lottery with only 6 tickets where one ticket is lethal. Should he play this game once? The probability is 83% that he gets $10 million. The probability is only 17% that he loses. Let's look at the consequences: If John doesn't play and there was a bullet he is glad he didn't play. If he plays and there is a bullet, he dies. If he doesn't play and there was no bullet he loses the pleasure which the extra money could have bought him. If he plays and there is no bullet he gains $10 million which would buy him extra pleasure. To play is to risk death in exchange for extra pleasure. There is an 83% probability that John is right but the consequence of being wrong is fatal. Even if the probabilities favor him, the downside is unbearable. Why should John risk his life? The value of survival is infinite, so the strategy of not playing is best no matter what probability we assign for the existence of "no bullet" or what money is being offered. But there may be exceptions. Someone that is poor, in need of supporting a family who knows he will die of a lethal disease within 3 months might pull the trigger. He could lose 3 months of life, 156 but if he wins, his family will be taken care of after his death.

Of course, one could try to “play it safe” by defecting until the other player cooperates, and only then starting to cooperate. The tournament results show, however, that this is actually a very risky strategy. The reason is that your own initial defection is likely to set off a retaliation by the other player. This will put the two of you in the difficult position of trying to extricate yourselves from an initial pattern of exploitation or mutual defection.

This, in turn, means that they will have relatively frequent interactions with these nearby individuals.

The message that reality was conveying to me was â€œYou better make sense of what happened to other people in other times and other places because if you donâ€™t you wonâ€™t know if these things can happen to you and, if they do, you wonâ€™t know how to deal with them.â€

Seek out the smartest people who disagreed with me so I could try to understand their reasoning. 2.Â Know when not to have an opinion. 3.Â Develop, test, and systemize timeless and universal principles. 4.Â Balance risks in ways that keep the big upside while reducing the downside.

I saw that to do exceptionally well you have to push your limits and that, if you push your limits, you will crash and it will hurt a lot. You will think you have failedâ€”but that wonâ€™t be true unless you give up. Believe it or not, your pain will fade and you will have many other opportunities ahead of you, though you might not see them at the time. The most important thing you can do is to gather the lessons these failures provide and gain humility and radical open-mindedness in order to increase your chances of success. Then you press on. My

“Here’s a case where someone successfully followed their passion,” they say, “therefore ‘follow your passion’ must be good advice.” This is faulty logic. Observing a few instances of a strategy working does not make it universally effective. It is necessary instead to study a large number of examples and ask what worked in the vast majority of the cases. And when you study a large group of people who are passionate about what they do, as I did in researching this book, you find that most—not all—will tell a story more complex than simply identifying a pre-existing passion and then pursuing it.

When your business is organized, you make it easy to start earning money. The reason why talented people don’t make money in freelancing is because there’s something blocking the transaction. They’re disorganized. If the freelancer’s pitch to clients sounds like a used car salesman’s pitch, money-hungry and fast...That’s blocking her income. If the freelancer doesn’t have a logical layout to her website, which creates a high bounce rate...That’s blocking her income. If the freelancer doesn’t bother renewing her domain name and her site’s down for a month before she realizes it...That’s blocking her income. The list of income blockers are endless, but again, the solution to earning money is clearing up these blocks by

When you are sick, what you like best is to be chosen for a Medicine in the first Place; what Experience tells you is best, is to be chosen in the second Place; what Reason (i.e. Theory) says is best, is to be chosen in the last Place. But if you can get Dr. Inclination, Dr. Experience and Dr. Reason to hold a Consultation together, they will give you the best Advice that can be given.
