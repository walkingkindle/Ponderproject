# Ponderproject


Ponder is a digital diary that helps people self-reflect and remember the passages, quotes and pages from their kindle,favorite books or just from a favorite author.
To get started:
1. Create an account and upload your 'My Clippings.txt' from your Kindle device.
2. My program will extract quotes from it and format them nicely, and then randomly choose one of the quotes for you.
3. Now comes the fun part. Write about the time the quote helped you or impacted your life. write or try to explain the quote to somoene else.

Don't use a kindle? No problem, just perform a manual search through Google Books API that will find the quote for you.

If you don't use a Kindle or don't read many books, just find one of our random quotes and start writing about them today!



With all 3 options, the app will make a blog post out of your favorite quote and what you wrote about it!
